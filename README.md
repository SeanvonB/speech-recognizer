# Speech Recognizer

[LIVE DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOK](https://seanvonb.github.io/speech-recognizer/)

This was my final for Udacity's [Natural Language Processing Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892), which I completed in late 2020. It's really a summative project for all of my School of AI Nanodegrees: [AI Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) and [Computer Vision](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) included; because it relies heavily on the knowledge from all three courses.

In data science terms, I should actually call this an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) pipeline. An ASR pipeline recieves spoken audio as input and returns a text transcript of the speech as output, so you'll often find this at the heart of speech recognition or dictation software.

## Features

-	Convert recorded speech into written text
-	Transform raw audio data into spectrogram or MFCC features
-	Test the performance of simple, deep, and bidirectional RNNs on this task
-	Test additional architecture options, like CNNs for feature extraction

## Credits

-   This project was part of [Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892).
-   Audio data was provided by Udacity as a select subset of the [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/)'s ASR corpus.
